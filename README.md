# Ryan Tremarco - Perosnal Portfolio

This webpage is used as a personal portfolio for Ryan Tremarco (me!). Currently hosted at [tremarco.dev](tremarco.dev).

It is a simple single-page React app hosted via Github Pages. You can use the following commands to get started:

```bash
npm install #Install dependencies
npm run css-watch #Or css-build, if you're not about hot-rebuilding
npm start #Start the app, in another terminal if using css-watch above
```
