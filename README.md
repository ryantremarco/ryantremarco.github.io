This webpage is used as a personal portfolio for Ryan Tremarco (me!). Currently hosted at [tremarco.dev](tremarco.dev).

It is a simple single-page React app hosted via Github Pages. You can use the following commands to get started:

```bash
npm install #Install dependencies
npm start #Start the app
npm run css-watch #Optionally run in a second terminal- keeps sass rebuilding as well
```
